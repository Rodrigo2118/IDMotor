  <Description>
    Identification of a Direct Current Motor.
    The objecive is to mimic the behaviour of a DC Motor given a voltage signal bewteen it's terminals.
    The signal, time and expected position/speed is provided by a .csv file.
    The input is the signal [V], the time [s] and the last position [rad] / speed [rad/s] and the output is the position [rad] / speed [rad/s]
